# An Introduction to R with the Tidyverse
R is one of the most popular open-source languages for data analysis. The tidyverse is a collection of powerful packages in R for common tasks, including data cleaning and visualization. The tidyverse provides a consistent and intuitive introduction to R and serves as a foundation for a growing number of packages in R (e.g., see the [tutorial on text analysis](https://github.com/marcdotson/tidy-text-analysis)). In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of using R and the tidyverse. Before the tutorial, participants should download and install the latest version of R [(cran.r-project.org)](https://cran.r-project.org) and RStudio [(www.rstudio.com)](https://www.rstudio.com).
