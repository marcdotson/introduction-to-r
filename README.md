# An Introduction to R with the Tidyverse
R is one of the most popular open-source languages for data analysis. The tidyverse is a collection of powerful packages in R for common tasks, including data cleaning and visualization. The tidyverse provides a consistent and intuitive introduction to R and serves as a foundation for a growing number of packages in R (e.g., see the [tutorial on text analysis](https://github.com/marcdotson/tidy-text-analysis)). In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of using R and the tidyverse.
